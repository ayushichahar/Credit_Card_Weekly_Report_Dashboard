 First Create a DATABASE in MySql or in Postgre for which I'm Using Postgre Sql
 Next, Create Two Tables : 1. CreditCard_Detail
                           2. Customer_Detail
 After that import data from the CSV files into Postgre Sql or MySql and after importing data into SQL server connect SQL to PowerBI for creating a Insightful Dashboard.
 Open PowerBI and from get data option choose your desire SQL server from which you can import the CSV files data.
